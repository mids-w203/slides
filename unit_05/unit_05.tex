  \note[item]{Introduce (a) green coffee (and its range of size and
    dryness); (b) the roaster; (c) the temperature scope; (d) the
    young gun; and (e) the tryer.}
  \note[item]{Introduce the tryer,then show trying before drop.}
  \note[item]{Within each of these ``trys'' I've got a sample that has
    been jumbled up for 10 minutes. I've drawn about 30 beans, each
    from the same distribution.}
  \note[item]{Ask students: In casual terms, would you say that the
    beans that I pull out are ``random''?}
  \note[item]{I sure would!}
  \note[item]{But, for our statistics to work, we need something that
    is different, and more specific than ``random'' -- we will need
    independent and identically distributed.} 
  \note[item]{The jumbling of these beans means that each bean's draw
    is independent of each other bean in the barrel.} 
\note[item]{\paul{What we're doing is proposing a model for where the
    data comes from, then asking if we believe it reminds us enough of
    the real world to be meaningful}} 
\note[item]{\paul{Depending on what the model is, the statement about
    independence makes more or less sense.}} 
\note[item]{\paul{If we identify the "distribution" with the
    population of beans currently in the roaster at the time you
    measure, then you get identically distributed for free - doesn't
    matter where the beans came from, they are the beans in the
    roaster by definition - and no need to state anything about
    screening, that shouldn't be relevant.}} 
\note[item]{\paul{I guess what I'm suggesting is that our phrasing
    needs to be "what kind of model is appropriate?" and "are there
    real world features that seem inconsistent with the iid assumption

  \item Data scientists are not given the joint density distribution.
    \note[item]{We're never given the joint pdf. It doesn't come in
      the instructions to being a data scientist.}
  \item One of our principle tasks is to produce \textit{estimates}
    about the \textit{universe} given only the limited information
    that we get from a sample of data.
    \note[item]{Because we have
      built these statements from axioms, we're able to know, that
      \textit{if these sets of assumptions are actually true} then we
      can produce an estimate that has known properties.}

  \begin{block}{Parameters, Statistics, and Estimators}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item A \textbf{paramater}, $\theta$, is some summary of the joint
      distribution.
    \item A \textbf{statistic} is some function that maps data from
      $\R^{n} \to \R$. 
    \item An \textbf{estimator}, $\hat{\theta}$, is some statistic of the
      data that we use to produce a guess for $\theta$.

      Here, we'll pass the data through function h and get estimator
      $\hat{\theta}$.  This could be any function, but really, we

  \frametitle{$\overline{X}$ is an Estimator}
  We refer to statistics that are ``good'' guesses for a population parameter as
  \textbf{estimators}. 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $\theta = \E[X]$ is a parameter.
  \item$T_{(n)} = \text{choose the 30}^{th} \text{ percentile}$ is a statistic
  \item $\hat \theta = \overline{X}$ is an estimator for $\theta$.

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Introducing Estimators}
  In this section, you will learn about the properties that make
  estimators good guesses for a population parameter.
  \begin{block}{Properties of estimators}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Consistency:} As sample size grows, does the estimator
    converge in probability to the true value? 
  \item \textbf{Bias} and \textbf{unbiasedness}: Is the estimator systematically too low or too
      high?
  \item \textbf{Efficiency:} Does an estimator have relatively
    \textit{large or small} sampling variance, standard error, and
    MSE? 
  \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
  \note[item]{\textbf{Consistency} Even if it is far from the truth in
    small samples, as $n$ increases, does an estimator $\hat{\theta}$
    get closer to the true value?}
  \note[item]{\textbf{Bias}: Across samples of any size, is an estimator
    systematically too low or too high?}
  \note[item]{\textbf{Efficiency}: Does a particular estimator have a
    relatively large or small mean squared error or sampling variance?
    If we have two estimators that are both unibased and consistent,
    I'd rather use the one that is closer to the truth on average.}

\section{Desirable Properties of Estimators}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Desirable Properties of Estimators}
  Throughout, we refer to $\theta$ as a population \textit{feature}
  or \textit{parameter}.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $\theta$ has a fixed, true value, but this value is not
    directly observable.
  \note[item]{Examples of $\theta$: sentiment in a user population;
      donations to senate campaigns; mean age of MIDS instructors}
  \item Without ground truth, how can we know if our estimator is
    doing its job?
  \end{itemize}
  \note[item]{Test-driven development, engineering,
    analogy -- software teams imagine every scenario possible, write
    a testing suite -- and conduct tests before releasing. That's
    how they know it ``works''. Because we don't know $\theta$ we
    can't do the same.}
  % \note[item]{\paul{Just to push on your
  % analogy a bit... it made me think of simulation studies, like
  % we did to see how efficient the classical and robust
  % estimators for ols error are.  That seems to be a bit like the
  % software approach}}
  % \note[item]{\alex{I agree! Let's not bring this up to the students just yet
  %   though.} }
  \note[item]{Reasoning and evaluating these properties is one of the
    reasons that we have invested in probablity theory!}  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Desirable Properties of Estimators: Unbiasedness}
  \begin{block}{Bias of an estimator}
    \note[item]{The bias of an estimator is the difference between the
      truth, and what you estimate. In this way, the term
      \textit{bias} has the same meaning as our plain-language
      meaning.}
    \note[item]{However, we cannot use it
      \textit{unthinkingly}. People say in plain language, ``They got
      biased treatment,'' and, ``It was a biased process.'' I suspect
      what they mean to say, ``They got prejudiced treatment.''}
    \note[item]{Notice also that in order to evaluate whether an
      estimate is biaesd, we \textit{need} a concept of what the true
      value is.} 
    The bias of an estimator is the expected difference between the
    \textit{true} population value and the estimator.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The \textit{bias} of $\hat{\theta}$ is $\E[\hat{\theta}] -
      \theta$.
    \item If $\E[\hat{\theta}] = \theta$, then there is no bias, and
      the estimator is \textit{unbiased}.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]
  \frametitle{Desirable Properties of Estimators: Unbiasedness (cont.)}
    If $\hat{\theta}$ is unbiased, does that mean that, for any sample
  taken, the estimate produced by $\hat{\theta} = \theta$?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $\hat{\theta}$ as an \textit{estimator} is a random variable.
  \item The value that it takes on given a sample is the
    \textit{estimate}. 
  \end{itemize}
  \note[item]{Draw an unbiased estimator!} 
  \note[item]{As a RV, $\hat{\theta}$ has a set of values that it can
    take on, and a probability distribution about those values.}
  \note[item]{The \textit{estimator}, $\hat{\theta}$ is unbiased if
    its expected value, $E[\hat{\theta}]$ is the same as the truth.}

    An estimator $\hat{\theta}$ is consistent for $\theta$ if

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Desirable Properties of Estimators: Review}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item An \textit{inconsistent} estimator is of little use.
  \item A \textit{more efficient} is estimator is preferable to a
    \textit{less efficient} estimator, all else equal.
  \item An \textit{unbiased} estimator is preferable to a
    \textit{biased} estimator, all else equal.
  \end{itemize}
  \note[item]{For inconsistent estimators, perhaps there is some level
    of $n$ that you get lucky and get the parameter estimate
    correct. But, \textbf{you don't know what that level is!}}
  \note[item]{More efficient estimators are preferrable, all else
    equal. But, in a business context there \textit{has} to be a
    tradeoff between cost and efficiency. How precise do you need to
    be?}

      \item Work to place the formal math definition into plan
        understanding. We will discuss this when you come back.
      \item Notice how $\mu$ and $\sigma^{2}$ are concepts that are
        immediately familiar, but they now represent population
        parameters.
    \end{itemize}

  \note[item]{The mathematical formalism in \textit{Definition 3.1.1} is
    probably overkill; we will talk about it when we come back.}

  \begin{block}{Definition: independent and identically distributed (IID)}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Undertake some process an arbitrary number of timesâ€”call
      it \textit{sampling}â€”to create a value from a phenomenon.
    \item If each instance of sampling draws from the same probability
      distribution, then we say the collection of values are
      \textbf{identically distributed}.
    \item If none of the instances of sampling provide information
      about other instances of sampling, then we say the collection of
      values are \textbf{independent}. 
    \end{itemize}
    \note[item]{Talk through the definitions first.}

  \note[]{\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{./images/coffee_delicious}}
  \note[item]{Each of the sets of \textit{trys} draws 30 beans at
    ``random''. But, are these draws i.i.d? }
  \note[item]{Problem 1: We have a finite sample in this roaster --
    there are 10,243 beans in it. Paul counted! Ha! After we draw and
    look at one, there are only 10,242 left to draw, and we've changed
  the distribution of the beans by taking one out. So, technically, we
  have a dependent sampling process.} 
  \note[item]{But, subsequent ``trys'' are not independent. When I
    know how roasted each bean in try (3) is, I know that each bean in
    try (4) is going to be more roasted.}
  \note[item]{Problem 2: The beans only get \textit{more} roasted. Time
    only goes fowrard, and in doing so, each of the distributions are
    related to one another}
  \note[item]{Problem 3: Suppose you get one \textit{really} roasted
    bean in try 1. Does that mean that in try 2 you're going to get
    anothe really roasted bean? No! The distributions are no
    indepenent, but all of the tries are.}
  \note[item]{Problem 4: What if all the big beans ``float'' to the
    top and so get less heat? Then we would have a non-independent
    distribution!} 
  \note[item]{Problem here is that I don't think you can
      define a model where a very roasted bean in try 1 gives you
      information that beans in try 2 are likely to be more roasted,
      but not that the next bean in try 1 is likely to be more
      roasted.  Any way I think of it, either both pairs are
      independent or not independent.}

  \frametitle{Making Assumptions}
  \begin{itemize}

    axiomatic.}
  \note[item]{We began with a principle, we looked at rules, and we

  \note[item]{As data scientists, we might sometimes posess the entire

    department''.} 
  \note[item]{Much more frequently we're interested in something else
    -- making a statement about a population from limited data.}
  \note[item]{What sets statistics apart is that it attempmts to
    characterize how certain we are about these predictions.}
  \note[item]{Without IID, we might be incorrectly confident --
    leading to unforseen events. Or, we might learn someting about a
    population that isn't informative of our target.}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item When data are independent and identically distributed (IID), it is possible to learn desirable things from
    a sample:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Accurate characterizations of the probability distribution
      function and values 
      \item Reliable characterizations of certainty and
        uncertainty
      \end{itemize}
    \item We can learn about unseen \textit{population parameters}

          now.}
        \note[item]{We know the idea of this joint distribution of an

\section{Sample Statistics}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Sample Statistics}
  Sample statistics are:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Functions that are applied to samples of random variables
    \note[item]{Why do we say that $X_{1}, X_{2}, \cdots, X_{3}$ are
      all random variables and not just realizations of a random
      variable?}  \note[item]{Make clear that sample statistics are
      \textbf{any} function of a random variable. Some are more useful
      than others, but they are just any mapping from
      $\mathbb{R}^{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ space} \note[item]{There
      are some \textit{classics} that we'll cover right now -- sample
      average, variance and standard error -- but also ranks, splines,
      factor loadings, space embeddings}
  \item \textit{Themselves} random variables
  \end{itemize}
    \note[item]{At this point, we don't have any guarantee about what
      the sample statistics will look like under repeated sampling. If

  about expected value and the sample variance of the sample average.
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Students will be provided with data and starter code that
    produces a population. 
  \item From this population, they will have sliders they can

    For IID random variables, $X_1,..X_n$, with population variance, $\V[X]$, the variance of the sample mean is

    \note[item]{Is this a good variance?  It really depends on the population distribution.  Depending on what the population looks like, there could be more efficient estimators.  But at least the dependency on $n$ is good.  we know that if we get enough data, we can get a low variance estimate.}

\note[item]{That's because the point estimate is not the same as the true parameter.}
\note[item]{If all you have is the point estimate, and no other way to judge how far off it might be, it may not be very valuable at all.}
\note[item]{If you're just messing around with data for fun, you may not care, but when the stakes get high, you realize you really need a way to capture that uncertainty.}

  \note[item]{Remember that a statistic IS a random variable}
  \note[item]{You get a single number.  But the model says that there are other values that are possible.}
  \note[item]{There is an entire probability distribution over possible values.}
  \note[item]{If we could see this distribution, we could understand how representative our one value is.}
  \note[item]{We could gauge how different it might be from the true parameter.}
  \note[item]{We can't see the sampling distribution, but if i.i.d. holds, we can still learn things about it.}
  \note[item]{A good first question: how spread out is it? standard error = standard deviation of the sampling dist.}
  \note[item]{You can think of the standard error as estimating, if you could run your study over and over, how far apart the values would be on average.  that's an important indicator of uncertainty.}

\frametitle{Capturing Uncertainty}
Need tools to capture how far off our estimate may be.
\begin{itemize}
\item Standard Error: the (estimated) standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the estimator.
\item But a standard error is just one number...
\end{itemize}

  \note[item]{We've talked about how important uncertainty is.}
  \note[item]{A point estimate by itself isn't all that useful.  we need a way to capture how far off it might be}
  \note[item]{One answer to that is the standard error, which is an estimate for the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of a statistic.}
  \note[item]{But the standard error doesn't capture everything about the sampling distribution.}
  \note[item]{It's just one number.  it can give you a general idea, but can't help you make precise statements about what parameter values are plausible.}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Uncertainty Example}
    \note[item]{Here's an example.  You want to understand whether vitamin W improves performance on a statistics test.}
  \note[item]{You don't know this, but vitamin W doesn't do anything}
  \note[item]{You estimate the performance, and it's positive, great!}
  \note[item]{But you know that there's uncertainty.  So you're not conviced the effect is really positive}
  \note[item]{You decide on this rule: if the estimate is at least 2 standard errors away from zero, you'll take the vitamin to market.}
  \note[item]{That's actually not a terrible rule of thumb.  This is a very very simplified version of a hypothesis test , but I think there's enough detail to make this point.}

         \vspace{-.8cm}
\begin{itemize}
\item Hidden fact: Population mean = 0
\item Idea: Market if estimate is 2 standard errors above 0.

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{The Importance of Shape}
       \center \includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{./images/equal_se}

  \note[item]{Here are three possible sampling distributions for the statistic.  All 3 of them have a mean of 0 and a standard error of 1.}
  \note[item]{So if you get an estimate of 2, you will take vitamin W to market.  and that's a mistake because the true effect is zero.}
  \note[item]{The question is, how likely are you to make a mistake in each case?}
  
  \note[item]{So the shape really matters when we want to express uncertainty more precisely.  That seems like a problem, because there are so many possible shapes out there.}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{The Central Limit Theorem}
  \note[item]{It turns out that a very famous theorem can help us.  It's called the CLT.}
  \note[item]{The CLT says that, yes, there are a lot of possible distributions out there.  If you have a small sample size, the variety is a big problem}
  \note[item]{But as the sample size grows large, the sampling distribution of the sample mean becomes more and more normal.}
  \note[item]{This is great because it's going to unlock a lot of important tools, including confidence interval and hypothesis tests.}
  \note[item]{Because of that, this is often viewed as the most important theorem in all of classical statistics}
  \begin{block}{Central limit theorem (CLT): idea}
    For a \textbf{very broad} class of population distributions, the sampling distribution of the mean becomes approximately normal as the sample size grows large.

  \item We also know that, as $n \to \infty$, we can generate an
    increasingly good estimate for $\V[X]$ because $$\overline{X^{2}} -
    \overline{X}^{2} \overset{p}{\to} \V[X]$$
    \item For more precise statements about uncertainty, we need the sampling distribution of the statistic.

  \note[item]{Then, suppose that you take a sample of size 2, and

    is the WLLN claim).}
  \note[item]{The idea of convergence in distribution, is
    that as you go along the sequence of distributions, the shape
    \textit{at every point} becomes more and more like the
    target; this is why it is defined in terms of CDF.}
  \note[item]{Convergence in distribution is much stronger than just a
    single point converging like we had for the
    WLLN. $\overset{p}{\to}$ covers a  single point or

      \begin{itemize}
\item Rule of Thumb: $n=30$ for CLT to "kick in."
\item Reality: Convergence depends on how non-normal population is.

\item A normal population requires $n=1$.
\item Highly skewed distributions may require $n=100$, $n=1000$, or more.

  \note[item]{If you want a function of the population variance, you can plug the sample variance into the function}
  \note[item]{So statisticians started to notice, hey, if we just plug in these sample analogues, we seem to get good estimators.}
  \note[item]{Is this just an accident?  Or is there something deeper going on?  Can we use this to find estimators for more parameters?}


  \begin{itemize}
  
  \item Want mean of population $\rightarrow$ Mean of sample.
  \item Want variance of population $\rightarrow$ Variance of sample.
  \item Want $f(E[X], V[X])$? $\rightarrow$ $f(\bar X, \hat V(X))$

    \begin{columns}
    \column{\dimexpr\paperwidth}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./images/plug-in}
  \end{columns}
\note[item]{It turns out, yes, there is something going on}
\note[item]{At the bottom, we have a population, represented as a CDF.  We apply expectation to it, to get the population mean}
\note[item]{Now at the top, we have our sample of data, represented by the empirical CDF.  Well, if you take the empirical distribution and apply expectation to it, you get the sample mean.}
\note[item]{What's key here, is that these expectations are exactly the same operator!  You really need to take measure theory to prove this, but hopefully that seems believable}
\note[item]{Now, what happens when $n \rightarrow \infty$?}
\note[item]{We know the empirical CDF converges in distribution on the population CDF.}
\note[item]{We need the expectation operator to be continuous, and that's not easy to define here.  but if it's smooth enough, as the empirical cdf approaches the true cdf, it makes sense that the sample mean approaches the population mean in probability. }
\note[item]{This works a lot of the time.  For a really large class of operators, if you plug in the empirical cdf for the true one, you get a consistent estimator.}
\note[item]{But that's not all.  these estimators are consistent, and they are also asymptotically normal}
\note[item]{That's harder to demonstrate, but here's a hint.  if you look at a point on the CDF function, you can write it as a sample mean - you add a 1 for every point to the left, an 0 for every point to the right.  So the distribution of this point approaches the normal.  So you can maybe believe that if the deviations are small enough, when you pass them through the expectation, you get another normal sampling distribution.}
\note[item]{So that's the plug-in principle.  It's pretty important, because it's also the basis for bootstrap theory.  It does take some advanced math to check that it actually applies to your estimator.  So we won't prove things with it in this class, but it's good to know that it exists, and we will use it to come up with ideas for estimators.}

  \begin{block}{Plug-In Estimators} 
    For i.i.d. random variables $X_{1}, X_{2}, \dots, X_{n}$, with a
    common CDF $F$, the plug in estimator for $\theta = T(F)$ is just
    $\hat{\theta} = T(\hat{F})$.
    \begin{align*}
      \hat{E}(X) &= T_{E}(\hat{F}) \\
                 & = \sum x \cdot \hat{f}(x) \\
                 & = \sum x \cdot \frac{I(X_{i} = x)}{n} \\
                 &= \frac{1}{n} \sum x \\ 
                 &= \overline{X} \\ 
    \end{align*}

    \item Cannot \textit{directly} observe the joint PDF.
    \item For discrete RV, approximations come through frequency
      tables.
    \item For continuous RV, approximations come through kernel
      density estimates:
      \end{itemize} 
    \[
      \hat{f}_{K}(x) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}K_{b}(x - X_{i}),
    \forall x \in \R\]

  As smoothing function, these permit plug in estimates that are
  directly analogous to the estimating functionals of the CDF.
  \begin{block}{Kernel Plug-In Estimator}
    The \textit{Kernel plug-in estimator} of $\theta = T(F)$
    is \[\hat{\theta}_{k} = T\big(\hat{F}_{K}\big),\] where,
    $\hat{F}_{K} = \int_{-\infty}^{x}\hat{f}(u)du$.

    \begin{block}{Kernel Plug-In Estimator for Expected Value}
      We know the functional for the expected value has a specific
      ``shape'' \[\E[Y] = \int y\cdot df(y).\] So, the feasible kernel method is
    \[\hat{\E}_{k}(\bs Y) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} y \cdot d\hat{f}_{K}(y)\]
  \end{block}

  \frametitle{Kernel Methods, part V}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $\E[Y]$ and $\E[Y|X]$ are lowest MSE estimates of $Y$
    \note[item]{But, $E[Y]$ and $E[Y|X]$ both require diety-level
      knowledge of the pdf or joint pdf.}
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{align*}
    \hat{\E}_{K}(\bs Y) &= \int y\hat{f}(y) \\ 
    \hat{\E}_{K}(\bs Y|X=x]) &= \int y \hat{f}_{Y|X}(y|x) \\
  \end{align*}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item If you can produce i.i.d. samples from $f_{Y|X}$, you can
    produce estimates, $\hat{f}_{K}(y|x)$ that get ever closer to the
    true value
  \end{itemize}
  \note[item]{The next sections in the course combine these facts with
    the CLT distributional shapes so that we can make \textbf{best}
    estimates, and we can communicate our uncertainty about these
    estimates.}
